# an illusion

NOTICE:  
OK, straight off the bat, hope u like this, 'cuz it has exactly 1,768 lines of basic python turtle code.   (yes, i counted)    

 
now to see what it does, theres no link or anything, and theres no website to see it on, and you cant download it, so i guess all you cand do is copy the code from the .py file, and paste it into an IDE or IDLE or whatever its called.  
 so what it does is making a not-so-illusion over and over again in like 6 different colors(im too lazy to count).
 and yeah.
 ### a picture(and SOME details)

check out what it looks like when its finished: dont worry, there are more colors
